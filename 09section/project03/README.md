## Project 3: Simple Casino Game

In this project, we will create a simple casino game using JavaScript. The game will generate three random numbers between 0 and 2. If all three numbers are the same, the player wins; otherwise, the player loses.

### Features

- Generate three random numbers between ["🍒", "🍋", "🍊"]
- Check if all three numbers are the same
- Display a message if the player wins or loses

### Steps to complete the project

- Create an index.html file.
- Create a styles.css file for basic styling.
- Create a scripts.js file to write JavaScript logic.
- Link styles.css and scripts.js to the index.html file.

### Hints

- Use the `Math.random()` function to generate random numbers.
- Use the `if...else` statement to check if all three numbers are the same.
- Use the `document.getElementById()` function to display the message to the player.

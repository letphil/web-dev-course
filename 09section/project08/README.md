## Project 8: Calculator

In this project, we will create a calculator app using JavaScript. The app will allow the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Clear the input field.
- Calculate the result of the expression.

### Steps to complete the project

- Create an `index.html` file.
- Create a `styles.css` file for basic styling.
- Create a `scripts.js` file to write JavaScript logic.

### Hints

- Use the `eval()` function to evaluate the expression.
- Use the `document.getElementById()` function to get the input field value.
- Use the `addEventListener()` function to handle button clicks.

## Project 6: Weather App

In this project, we will create a weather app using JavaScript. The app will display the current weather information for a specific location, including the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

### Features

- Display the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a specific location.
- Allow the user to search for a location and get the weather information.
- Display an error message if the location is not found.

### Steps to complete the project

- Create an `index.html` file.
- Create a `styles.css` file for basic styling.
- Create a `scripts.js` file to write JavaScript logic.
- Link `styles.css` and `scripts.js` to the `index.html` file.

### Hints

- Use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather information.
- Use the `fetch()` function to make API requests.
- Use the `document.getElementById()` function to get the elements by their ID.

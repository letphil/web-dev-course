# Project 10: Memory Game

In this project, we will create a memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will have a grid of cards, and the player will have to match pairs of cards. The game will keep track of the player's score and the time taken to complete the game.

## Features

- A grid of cards with hidden symbols.
- The player can click on a card to reveal the symbol.
- The player can click on another card to reveal the symbol.
- If the symbols match, the cards stay open.
- If the symbols do not match, the cards close.
- The game keeps track of the player's score.
- The game keeps track of the time taken to complete the game.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched.

## Steps to complete the project

- Create an `index.html` file.
- Create a `styles.css` file for basic styling.
- Create a `scripts.js` file to write JavaScript logic.

## Hints

- Use the `addEventListener()` function to handle card clicks.
- Use the `classList` property to add and remove classes from elements.
- Use the `setTimeout()` function to delay actions.
- Use the `Math.random()` function to shuffle the cards.
- Use the `Date.now()` function to get the current time.
- Use the `textContent` property to set the text content of an element.

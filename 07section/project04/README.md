## Project 4: Drag and Drop Game

In this project, we will create a drag and drop game using JavaScript. The game will have a list of items that the player can drag and drop into a specific area.

### Features

- Create a list of items that the player can drag and drop.
- Create a specific area where the player can drop the items.
- Display a message if the player wins or loses.

### Steps to complete the project

- Create an `index.html` file.
- Create a `styles.css` file for basic styling.
- Create a `scripts.js` file to write JavaScript logic.
- Link `styles.css` and `scripts.js` to the `index.html` file.

### Hints

- Use the `ondragstart`, `ondragover`, and `ondrop` events to create the drag and drop functionality.
- Use the `document.getElementById()` function to get the elements by their ID.
- Use the `event.preventDefault()` function to prevent the default behavior of the dragged element.

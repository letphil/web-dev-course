  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

### Bootstrap Grid System

- The Bootstrap grid system is based on a 12-column layout.
- You can create responsive layouts by dividing the page into 12 columns and placing content in the columns.
- To create a grid layout, use the `.container`, `.row`, and `.col` classes provided by Bootstrap.
- The `.container` class creates a fixed-width container for the content.
- The `.row` class creates a horizontal row to contain the columns.
- The `.col` class specifies the width of the column based on the number of columns it should span.

### Example

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">Column 1</div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">Column 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Bootstrap Components

- Bootstrap provides a variety of components that you can use in your projects.
- Some of the common components include buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, and carousels.
- You can customize the appearance and behavior of these components using Bootstrap classes and Javascript plugins.
- Bootstrap components are designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.

### Responsive Design

- Responsive design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
- Responsive design ensures that web pages look good and are easy to use on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Bootstrap provides responsive utilities and classes that allow you to create responsive layouts and elements.
- You can use classes like `.d-none`, `.d-sm-block`, `.d-md-none`, and `.d-lg-flex` to show or hide elements based on the screen size.

### Example

```html
<div class="d-none d-md-block">
  This element is hidden on small screens and visible on medium screens and
  above.
</div>
<div class="d-md-none">
  This element is visible on small screens and hidden on medium screens and
  above.
</div>
```

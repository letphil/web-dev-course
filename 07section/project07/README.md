## Project 7: To-Do List

In this project, we will create a to-do list app using JavaScript. The app will allow the user to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed.

### Features

- Add a new task to the to-do list.
- Edit an existing task.
- Delete a task from the list.
- Mark a task as completed.
- Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed).
- Clear all completed tasks.

### Steps to complete the project

- Create an `index.html` file.
- Create a `styles.css` file for basic styling.
- Create a `scripts.js` file to write JavaScript logic.

### Hints

- Use the `localStorage` API to store the tasks locally.
- Use the `document.createElement()` function to create new elements.
- Use the `addEventListener()` function to handle user interactions.
- Use the `classList` property to add or remove classes from an element.

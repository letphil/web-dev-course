## Project 5: Quiz App

In this project, we will create a quiz app using JavaScript. The app will display a list of questions with multiple-choice answers. The player can select an answer for each question, and the app will display the final score at the end.

### Features

- Display a list of questions with multiple-choice answers.
- Allow the player to select an answer for each question.
- Display the final score at the end of the quiz.

### Steps to complete the project

- Create an `index.html` file.
- Create a `styles.css` file for basic styling.
- Create a `scripts.js` file to write JavaScript logic.
- Link `styles.css` and `scripts.js` to the `index.html` file.

### Hints

- Use an array of objects to store the questions and answers.
- Use the `document.getElementById()` function to get the elements by their ID.
- Use the `addEventListener()` function to handle click events on the answers.

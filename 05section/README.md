### Project Requirements

   - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
   - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
3. Design and implement a simple "Coming Soon" landing page for a fictional company or product.
4. The landing page should include the following elements:
   - A header section with the company or product name.
   - A countdown timer that displays the time remaining until the launch date.
   - A brief description of the company or product.
   - A call-to-action button that encourages visitors to sign up for updates.

### Project Guidelines
